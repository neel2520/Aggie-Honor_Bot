# aggie-honor-bot
Aggie Honor Bot is a project that was inspired by a TAMUHack 2020 project by the same name (see TAMUHack branch for initial prototype). 
Aggie Honor Bot is a proprietary webserver and chat manager currently being built for academic GroupMe chats. This is a personal project 
being developed by four friends at Texas A&M, Trevor Bolton, Rebecca McFadden, Kyle Myscich, and Neel Pochareddy. We currently plan on 
developing a fully functioning solution to solve one of the biggest problem that faces college class group chats.
